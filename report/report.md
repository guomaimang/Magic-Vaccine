## Introduction
COVID-19 has received concern from the whole world, and people from the whole world are fighting against the epidemic together. To understand the spread of virus, human must figure out what factors affect the spreading speed. In this project, we try to find what can affect the virus, and the relation between spread speed and possible factors.

## Motivation

The very first intuition we choose the topic "Data analysis on the influencing factors of development of Covid-19" is deep interest. There are large number of people in Kong Kong starting to take the vaccine. Some of the people do not know much about the effectiveness of vaccine. Some of people are questioning about the effectiveness. Therefore, as a group of students who are interested in the facts and truths behind the vaccine. We have strong desire to find out the real impact of the vaccine.

However, before a scientific research is conducted, only interest is not enough. The research topic should be proved to valuable and worthy to discuss. After looking into various papers, we find out that theoretical value and reality research are two main issues which should be taken into consideration. On the theoretical side, large number of related paper can be found and "Covid-19" and "related vaccine" are both the hot key words in the academic library. On the reality side, this topic is proven to be useful because its result will benefit the government and the healthcare organization to take measurement. Also, this topic is closely to the hot and crucial social issue nowadays. 

Finally, although this topic is challenging, it allows us to combine what we learn on this course with creative thinking. We can apply the linear regression model, basic techniques of processing data in this research. We can also learn by ourselves and explore new models and algorithms in this research. 

Therefore, based on "interest, research value and learning exercise" these three aspects, this topic is decided.

## Background


## Description
We have concluded that COVID-19 may be affected with a few factors, and we have classified these factors into groups including time, virus, vaccine, government, population and economic groups. All these groups may have more or less effects on virus spread. Also, different models including linear regression are all used to test for the best fit. 

In this project, we define a few independent variables which are related to
